# Sections

### Display order:

The `displayOrder` array controls the order of sections on the website. Any section not listed in the arrays will not be displayed.
Example:
```json
"displayOrder": ["shortBio","projects", "work", "education", "awards", "volunteer", "social"]
```

Note: `social` is the `profiles` in the `personal` section.
### Personal:

All the elements in personal section are optional. All the social media profiles can be listed in the `profiles` array. Icons are from [zocial](https://github.com/smcllns/css-social-buttons).

Example:
```json
"personal": {
    "name": "Navdeep Sekhon",
    "title": "Software Developer",
    "email": "sekhon@navdeep.co",
    "phone": "123-456-7890",
    "website": "http://www.navdeepsekhon.com",
    "shortBio": "Hello! I am Navdeep Sekhon. I make stuff. Here's some of it.",
    "location": "Delaware",
    "profiles": [
      {
        "network": "Twitter",
        "url": "http://twitter.com/navdeepsekhon9"
      },
      {
        "network": "github",
        "url": "http://decompile.xyz"
      },
      {
        "network": "linkedin",
        "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/navdeepsekhon"
      },
      {
        "network": "facebook",
        "url": "facebook.com/navdeepsekhon6"
      }
    ]
  }
```


### Projects:

This is my favourite. You can create different sections of projects and multiple projects in each section. Eg: Frontend/Backend/Mobile etc.

`projectSections` is an array of project section objects. Each section has a `title` and a list of `projects`.

Example:
```json
"projectSections": [
       {
      "title": "FrontEnd",
      "projects" :[ ... ]
    },
    {
      "title": "BackEnd",
      "projects" :[ ... ]
     }
   ]
```

There are different kind of projects depending on what information you provide for each project.
* If you provide an array in `description`, it will rendered as bullet points.
* If you provide a string `description`, it will be rendered as a center aligned paragraph.
* If you provide `gallery` array with a bunch of image links, it will render a slideshow of images.

Example:
```json
  [{
        "title": "Project with bulleted description",
        "link": "https://github.com/navdeepsekhon/AndroidWeatherApp/",
        "thumbnail": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navdeepsekhon/portfolio-generator/master/screenshot.PNG",
        "description": [
          "Bullet 1",
          "Bullet 2"
          ...
          ]
        },
        {
          "title": "Project with image gallery",
          "thumbnail": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navdeepsekhon/AndroidWeatherApp/master/screenshots/tablet_mainscreen.png",
          "link": "https://github.com/navdeepsekhon/AndroidWeatherApp/",
          "description": "To create an image gallery in pop up, put the image URLs comma separated in gallery: []",
          "gallery": [
            "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navdeepsekhon/AndroidWeatherApp/master/screenshots/phone_detailscreen_portrait.png",
            "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navdeepsekhon/AndroidWeatherApp/master/screenshots/phone_mainscreen.png",
            ...
           ]
        }

```

### Work/Volunteer

* If you provide a `website` the organization name will be a link.
* If you provide an array of `highlights` it will create a collapsible bullet list

### Education/Awards
See demo portfolio for examples.

### Remove "Designed By Navdeep Sekhon"

If you want to remove the "Designed By Navdeep Sekhon" at the bottom of the page(it's ok, I don't mind), just set `hideDesignedBy` to true.
```json
"hideDesignedBy": true,
```
### Contributions

Please feel free to report any bugs or send in pull request with code changes.

I love it when my work helps someone. So if you're using this project or it inspired you to build something of your own, I'd love to know! My social media is listed on my portfolio :)


#### Host your portfolio free using github pages :

I host my portfolio using github pages. To use the framework to make your site, you just need to change resume.json and update the `RESUME_LOCATION` in `constants.js` and you're good to go.
